Rivet `1.7.0` is now available! This release introduces the timeline component as well as a few bug fixes and improvements.

## Timeline component
This release introduces the new [timeline component]({{< ref "/components/page-content/timeline.md" >}}) which allows you to show chronologically-ordered information in a visually meaningful way.

The timeline is available in a handful of configurations that can be used to display different types of content. [Check out the documentation]({{< ref "/components/page-content/timeline.md" >}}) for more details.

## Complete list of updates
For a complete breakdown of the `1.7.0` updates, see the [Rivet changelog]({{< ref "components/information/changelog.md" >}}).
