Rivet `1.7.2` is now available! This release fixes some small styling issues, improves accessibility, and refactors JavaScript syntax.

## Style refinements
This release saw updates to several components' styling. These include updating the border for the mobile menu header and the disabled button styles for the loading indicator.

## Accessibility improvements
This release included multiple accessibility improvements. We removed `aria-describedby` in favor of `aria-hidden` for the trident `svg` in the header component. We also updated the modal component to trap focus when tabbing backward upon first opening the modal.

## Complete list of updates
For a complete breakdown of the `1.7.2` updates, see the [Rivet changelog]({{< ref "components/information/changelog.md" >}}).
