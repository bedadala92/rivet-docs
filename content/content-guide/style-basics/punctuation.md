## Colons
Capitalize the first word after a colon, **only** if what follows is a complete sentence. For example:

<blockquote>I have several favorite foods: apples, bananas, and naan chips.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I have several favorite foods: Apples were my first favorite snack, but naan chips are a rising star in my life.</blockquote>

## Quotes
These quotations are correctly punctuated:

<blockquote> "Would you like a banana?" he asked.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"I hate bananas," she said. "You know I hate bananas."</blockquote>

<blockquote>He paused before saying "bananas are not something people should hate."</blockquote>

## Spaces
Sentences should always be separated by a single space. Never two spaces.

## Slashes
Avoid using the slash symbol (/). Replace it with words or commas as appropriate.
